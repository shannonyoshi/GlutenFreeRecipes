# Chewy Browned Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies
### Yield: 24 Cookies
## Ingredients
- 200 grams (1 cup + 1 Tbsp) All-Purpose GF Flour
- 1/4 tsp. Xanthan Gum
- 1¼ tsp. (4 g) Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt
- ¾ tsp. (4 g) baking soda
- ¾ cup (1½ sticks; 169 g) unsalted butter, divided
- 200 grams dark brown sugar
- 50 grams granulated sugar
- 4 large egg yolks
- 2 tsp. vanilla extract
- 6 oz. (170 g) bittersweet chocolate (60%–70% cacao), coarsely chopped, or semisweet chocolate chips

## Directions
1. In a small bowl, whisk dry ingredients (flour, kosher salt, baking soda)
2. In a small heavy bottom pot over medium heat, cook butter, sstirring frequently, until milk solids are lightly browned. (The butter solids will get a little more brown fron residual heat in the pan, so light browning is to prevent burning/over cooking)
3. In a large heatproof bowl, add browned butter. Slice the remaining butter into thin pieces. Test add a piece of butter to the bowl. If the resh butter doesn't bubble, add the rest.
4. Once all butter is melted, add the brown and granulated sugars and whisk well. 
5. Whisk in egg yolks one at a time, then add the vanila and whisk some more.
6. If the flour is cliumpy, sift into the butter bowl and mix until just combined. Add the chocolate chips.
7. Rest the dough in the refrigerator for an hour, scoop 16 2-Tbsp sized balls onto 2 cookie sheets.
8. Bake for 5 minutes, then add Maldon salt to top, rotate cookie sheet and return to oven until the center is no longer shiny and outside of the cookies is browned, approximately 4-6 additional minutes.

## Storage
- Make ahead and freeze for up to several months:
    1. Place dough balls close together, and flatten slightly into a disk. Freeze cookie dough for several hours. 
    2. Remove dough from cookie sheet, and place dough disks into a freezer bag.
    3. Sprinkle with Maldon salt, then bake from frozen in 350 oven for ~10 minutes.

### Notes
- Based on Bon Appetit's "Best Chocolate Chip Cookies" by Chris Morocco

#### Test 1: 
- Did a half batch using Bob's Red Mill GF All Purpose Flour, and no whole eggs, sprinkled Maldon salt on top prior to baking.
**Results**
- Initial Thoughts: Dough is grainy, flour doesn’t taste great (it’s old)
- Fresh out of the oven: salt became difficult to see; taste is good, outside is a bit chewy, cookies turned out quite flat. Next time don’t flatten cookie dough for cookies not going into the freezer
- Next Day: After sitting for a day, cookies became more chewy overall.
**Possible Adjustments**
- [x] indicated changes has been made in recipe
- [x] Add Maldon Salt half way through baking time at the same time as rotating pan.
- [ ] Increase Xanthan Gum to test how this affects baked goods.
- [x] Make cookies smaller since they browned exterior was  more chewy than the interior.
- [x] Remove whole egg, and replace with 4 egg yolks
