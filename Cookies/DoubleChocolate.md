# Double Chocolate Chip Cookies

TODO: add weight measurements for ingredients
## Ingredients
- ½ cup all-purpose flour (or ½ cup gluten free all-purpose flour, + ⅛ teaspoon xanthan gum if GF flour does not contain xanthan nor guar gums)
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 pound semisweet or darker chocolate, chopped
- ¼ cup (½ stick) unsalted butter
- 1 ¾ cups dark brown sugar 
- 4 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 8 oz semisweet chocolate chips
- 1 cup walnuts, toasted and chopped

## Directions
1. In a small bowl, incorporate flour, (xanthan gum if using,) baking powder, and salt, then set aside.
2. Over a double boiler, melt chocolate and butter together. Once melted, remove from heat and let cool.
3. In a stand mixer or using electric beaters, whisk eggs and sugar until thick (about 5 min).
4. Add the chocolate mixture to the egg mixture, and continue to beat until incorporated.
5. Sift the flour mixture into the batter, and incorporate using a spoon until almost smooth.
6. Add the walnuts and chocolate chips and stir until evenly distributed.
7. Let rest, covered, in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour (extra important if using gluten free flour)
8. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Make dough balls of 1 ½ tablespoons, then bake 2 inches apart for 10-12 minutes or until the top of the cookies appears dry and cracked on top, but still soft in the center. Makes 36 cookies.

## Storage
- For freshly baked cookies anytime: After making dough balls, flatten them slightly to resemble disks. Pack a cookie sheet tightly with dough disks, and freeze for several hours before transferring to an air tight container. Bake from frozen at 325 degrees for 12 minutes (or longer).

### Notes:
- Original Recipe from Caitlin uses 5 (1.4oz) chocolate covered english toffee bars instead of chcolate chips
